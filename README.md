AquaCMS
=======

This Content Management System is going to be built as a simpler and easy-to-access system. 
It has many features I would like to add to it, for example:
- Option to work without Database
- Modules/Themes
- Inline HTML Content Editor with File management, 
  with the main options as overlays instead of separate pages.
- Fully customizable HTML output
- Semantic Mark-up
