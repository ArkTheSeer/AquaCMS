AquaCMS
=======

This Content Management System is going to be built as a simpler and easy-to-access system. 
It has many features I would like to add to it, for example:
- Option to work without Database
- Modules/Themes
- Inline HTML Content Editor with File management, 
  with the main options as overlays instead of separate pages.
- Fully customizable HTML output
- Semantic Mark-up
- Ability to create widgets and load them as ajax (with fallback)
- Menu manager
- User manager with roles and restrictions
- Ajax form maker with fallback
- Simple but awesome starter theme
- An automatic installer

To start off, you must:

1. Go to the folder 'sys' and open the 'config.php' file.
2. There you can set up everything (the comments lead you)
3. If you want your site to use database, you must set that up.
4. If you want your site to be file based, you must set up the 'pages' folder with a '_meta.php' file, example soon.
